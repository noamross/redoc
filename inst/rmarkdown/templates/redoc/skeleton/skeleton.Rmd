This is an example Reversible R Markdown document. It will preserve code
elements for restoration in your final `.docx` file.

You can use things like inline <!--- an HTML comment ---> comments.

You can use code chunks to generate output and they will be restored:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

Inline text
-----------

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
# A non-included chunk to provide inline chunks with values.
a <- 2
b <- 3
```

You can include calculations inline like so: `r a` plus
`r b` equals `r a + b`. Even empty inline chunks `r NULL` will be stored and
marked with hidden text in the Word document.

Chunks with plots
-----------------

You can of course also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, dev.args=list(bg='transparent')}
plot(pressure)
```

## Track Changes

**redoc** supports [Critic Markup](http://criticmarkup.com/users-guide.php)
syntax for comments.  You can {++ include ++} edits and they will be converted
to {~~ tacked ~> tracked ~~} changes in your {== Word document ==}{>> Neat! <<}.
By default {-- default --}, your system username is used as the author of
changes, but this can be set with the `comment_author` argument in `redoc()`
or your document YAML.
